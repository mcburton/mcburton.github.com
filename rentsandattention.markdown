[Conversation is the new attention](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conversation-is-the-new-attention/)

If "Conversation is the new Attention" what are the implications of the fact that we are renting infrastructure (with our money or attention(ads))? There is a lot of power now concentrated in the hands of the companies that control the infrastructure, for now they can (theoretically) control the conversation. Now, there is an important point to make about how they control the conversation; they do not control the content (although they can for corporations are not beholden to first amendment rights), but they do control the architecture of the infrastructure AND they are the gatekeepers of access. 



Thesis - We rent access to infrastructure with our attention.
    - this only applies to free infrastructure
    
    - google, facebook, twitter what to keep the conversations going in and on their infrastructure

Conclusion:

What does "access trumps ownership" 
    depends on the thing, rival vs non-rival
    Music - buying music vs renting access to a library of music
    
    renting vs buying a house
    
    This is an issue of property. Is this related to attention.
    
What is being controlled is the conduit for conversation. 
Who owns the conversation?
